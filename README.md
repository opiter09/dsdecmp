Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/dsdecmp


This tool allows for decompressing and compressing in popular NDS file compression schemes. According to its original Google Code page, it supports:

- LZ77/LZSS (types 0x10, 0x11 and 'Overlay')

- Huffman (only data lengths 8 and 4)

- Run-Length Encoding


In addition, this fork includes an MIT License, since that is what the code came with (see https://web.archive.org/web/20141223223529/https://code.google.com/p/dsdecmp/),
and also a compiled exe the Wayback Machine somehow saved, so no-one has to try to compile it.
